### Introduction
Have you ever felt anxious before getting on a plane? Or have you ever worried about your safety while you were on a plane? The members here at group 6 would like to ease your worries. We decided to create a project that examines the crash records of passenger planes from 1933-2009 to determine which types of planes are the safest for your travels. Our topic is called Journey in safe airplanes, the dataset we used for this topic is called Large passenger plane crashes from 1933 to 2009. This dataset was created by Juan C Ventosa, but was derived from another dataset called AirplaneCrashesandFatalitiesSince_1908.csv made by  Sauro Grandi. From this dataset we answer some of  the following questions: Overall aboard and fatalities, Which plane had the most crashes, which route has the most crashes and more.
